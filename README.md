# Image_Resolution_Enhancer_SRGAN
This project uses a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to enhance the resolution of images by 4x. Users can upload low-resolution images, and the web application—built using Flask—processes these images with a pre-trained SRGAN model, returning high-quality images.
